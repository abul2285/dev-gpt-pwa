## How Dev GPT Works

### Code Explanation

Dev GPT uses advanced natural language processing to explain code snippets in a human-readable manner. When you provide a code segment, Dev GPT dissects it step by step, highlighting the purpose of each line and explaining the overall logic.

### Test Case Generation

Generating comprehensive test cases is crucial for maintaining code quality. Dev GPT generates a suite of test cases for your functions, covering a wide range of inputs and edge cases. This helps you identify potential issues and ensure your code behaves as expected.

### Function Implementation

Struggling to implement a complex function? Describe your idea to Dev GPT using input-output examples, and it will generate a functional code snippet for you. This feature is especially helpful when you have a high-level understanding of what the function should do but need assistance with the actual coding.
